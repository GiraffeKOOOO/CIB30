       <h1>Four square - press the pack</h1>
  This is a great session for getting players to pass with accuracy and speed<br> 
  when under pressure which means on match days they are able to keep hold of the ball when pressed by the opposition.<br>
  <h3> Why join it</h3>
   The session involves players being put under pressure, making quick decisions in tight areas and then trying to think ahead and reacting quickly to changing situations.
  <h3> Set up the activity</h3>
   You need balls, bibs and cones. Set up Set up a grid of four 10—10-yard boxes with a central 2—2-yard diamond.<br>
    We used 12 players in the session.
  <h3> How to play it</h3>
   Start with four defenders in the central diamond, a possession team of four in one box,<br> and another team of four split amongst the three remaining boxes.<br> The possession team must try to string five passes together under pressure from one of the defenders,<br> who joins from the central diamond. <br>When they have achieved five passes, the possession team pass into one of the other three squares, <br>where the other team of four join together to play against a new defender from the central area.<br> The original possession team disperse to the three unoccupied squares, and the first defender returns to the central diamond.<br> Play continues in the same manner. The defending team perform that role for two minutes before swapping with another team.<br> To intensify the pace, progress the activity by asking the possession team to play into another square after just three passes, <br>but the transferring pass must be first time.

<h3> Technique</h3>
The possession players need to concentrate and show you they are technically good.<br> Their passing has to be accurate and precise.<br> They also have to think ahead, knowing where they are going to play the ball before they receive it.<br> The defenders have to use a high tempopress and be prepared towork hard in short bursts.

 1. Play a 4v1 in the squares – the target is 5 passes without the lone defender touching the ball<br>2. When the target number of passes have been reached the 4 players in the other squares join up in one square and a new defender comes from the central zone.

 3. The first defender returns to the central zone and the 4 passers disperse across the three free squares4.<br> Defenders defend for 2 minutes then swap5. Progress the session by reducing the number of passes needed from 5 to 3 but the last pass must be first time.
