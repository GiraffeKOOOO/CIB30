<h2>In Other News</h2>
<h3>FIFA Being Bribed?</h3>

It has been more recently shown that unfortunately FIFA (Internation Federation Of Football) is still accepting <br>
AND is blatantely obvious about it when it comes to bribes. This is because as of November 27th, a statement has <br>
been provided by the former President of Colombia's Soccer Federation, where he openly states that there was a big <br>
$15 million budget set aside just for South American Officials (game Referees) from Qatari. Meaning, that any game played <br>
in Colombie could've been very inaccurate, biased, and unfair for the players. Which can be found very disgusting, as well <br>
as ridiculous, especially towards the players which put in tremendous amounts of effort in this sport.
