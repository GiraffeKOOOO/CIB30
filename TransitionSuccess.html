      <h1>Transition success</h1>
      In the professional game there are around 200 turnovers of the ball in every match, <br> so players need to practice how to deal with them.<br> Reacting to turnover balls is vital at youth level because often teams are switched off to the positives and negatives.<BR>
  <h3> Why join it</h3>
   This session is about counter-attacking, transition and players rotating in their positions.<br> Attackers practice good link up play and fast paced combinations and decision making. Defenders work against overloads.
  <h3> Set up the activity</h3>
   You need balls, bibs, cones and goals. Set up a 60 x 40 yard area split into two halves with goals at each end. <br>We’ve used 16 players in this session plus a server
  <h3> How to play it</h3>
  Split your players into two equal teams of 8 players. There should be 3 defenders and a goalkeeper in the team’s half with 2 attackers in the other half.<br> The other 2 attackers start either side of their own goal. <br>To begin the two attackers next to the goal pass to one of the two attackers in the other half of the pitch, then support their team mates and create a 4v3 overload.<br> Attackers have 10 seconds to score. IF no goal is scored in this time possession is overturned and the other team goes.

<h3> Technique</h3>
Transitioning from attacking to defending and reorganising quickly to cover the change – positional sense and tactics are key here.

 1. Play starts with the attackers beside their goal – encourage your players to show high tempo and intent to score a goal<br>2. The attackers play a ball to a team mate in the other half of the pitch and follow the pass.

 3. Teams have 10 seconds to score if they don’t score the other team gets possession<br> 4. Players must try to combine and score using the <br>4v3 overload in their favour
