<p><i>This is a fairly long paragraph, which describes a little bit of information about the <br> maker of this website
although it may seem like an excuse to demonstrate breakers in html <br>
that is definitively not the case. So the maker of this website is called Roger, he is a young <br>
handsome transgender male, which spends his spare time writing websites in HTML as that is his <br> true passion.</i></p>
