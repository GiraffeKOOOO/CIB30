 <h1>Five minute warm up</h1>
      Get to the opposite group - go when your number is called. <br>
        This is a great warm-up to get the players ready for passing and receiving in a match.<br>
  
  <h3> How to do it</h3>
   Arrange your players into two groups.<br>
Let the two groups number themselves 1 to 4.<br>
Tell the players to continually pass the ball and move in their areas.<br>
Call out a number and that player must sprint across to the opposite area to join that team and continue to pass and move.<br>
OR call out a number and that player must dribble the ball across to the opposite area.
  

<h3> Technique</h3>
Vital that there is good passing and receiving with good first touch and accuracy on the pass

 1. Play a 4v1 in the squares â€“ the target is 5 passes without the lone defender touching the ball<br>2. When the target number of passes have been reached the 4 players in the other squares join up in one square and a new defender comes from the central zone
